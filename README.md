# crx-tab-finder
## 0.3.2
### Google Chrome extension to find an opened tab

Goals :

1. display the list of currently opened tabs, even spread across multiple windows
2. filter the list by searching by tabs's title and/or tab's URL
3. navigate to the selected tab, and bring its containing window to the foreground
4. create a new tab or a new window with the pre-filled omnibox

For now I only have the source code on bitbucket in a private repository, here:
https://bitbucket.org/floverdevel/crx-tab-finder

If you're interested to test it and SEND ME YOUR FEEDBACK all it takes his a bitbucket username so I can give you read access.
Eventually I will officially distribute the plugin on Google Play Store but until then you have the honor of being my _beta-testers_

To install, follow the documentation for Google:
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked

This project started as proof of concept (POC) and it proved to be functional rather quickly
Also, it's very alpha version, so, for now :
- No clean code
- No automated testing
