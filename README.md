## 0.5.3
### Google Chrome extension to find an opened tab

Goals :

1. display the list of currently opened tabs, even spread across multiple windows
2. filter the list by searching by tabs's title and/or tab's URL
3. navigate to the selected tab, and bring its containing window to the foreground
4. possibility to create a new tab (inside actual window or in a new window) with the pre-filled omnibox
5. close a tab

For now I only have the source code on bitbucket in a private repository, here:
https://bitbucket.org/floverdevel/crx-tab-finder

If you're interested to test it and SEND ME YOUR FEEDBACK all it takes his a bitbucket username so I can give you read access.
Eventually I will officially distribute the plugin on Google Play Store and/or Google Chrome Webstore but until then you have the honor of being a _beta-testers_.

To install from source code, follow the instructions from Google Chrome Extensions Developer website:
https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked

This project started as proof of concept (POC) and it proved to be functional rather quickly.
